## Hello, my name is Jamie Baker!
### Welcome,
I am an undergraduate student at Stonehill College. I am currently doing research on behavioral ecology of Trinidaian guppies, observing how visual cues influence antipredator behavior. I am a senior looking to pursue a Phd in molecular biology, with a focus in translational research. After recieving my graduates degree I would like to work as a post doctorate in a lab at a university where I could teach and continue research. 

My portfolio repository includes a example of a function tutorial from that packages flashr and supportR presented to undergraduate students at Stonehill College and an expample of my work while learning to code in R, making loops.
